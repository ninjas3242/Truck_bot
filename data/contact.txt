EXCELLENCE - QUALITY – SERVICE
No fence is high enough!
Our Stephex Group is the world leader in the horsetrucks market. We are also very proud of our horses and their riders as they often place at the top of world rankings. This success was built on a dream. And we are still working on that very dream every single day.

Our sporting results have made our reputation and confirmed our company’s philosophy: we thrive for all-round excellence in order to achieve perfection in everything we do. Quality is the starting point and the motto of our group.
We would not have been able to achieve this dream without Stephan Conter, the founder and engine of the group. When you spend time with Stephan, you realize that anything is possible.

Corporate life is full of ups and downs. In 2008 our barn won an Olympic medal and this really launched the Stephex Group into global recognition. At that moment we felt that our dream had finally become a reality. We really felt like we were on the right path. And today nothing could stir us away from this path.

The unknown is our playground.
the innovation,
our daily challenge.
We only buy exceptional horses. We take the time to discover them, we bring them into the world and we also make them available to other horse enthusiasts. This is actually what our entire life is about: we spend time prospecting, innovating, investing. We embrace the unknown. Innovating is our daily challenge. We break new ground every single day. We are where you least expect us to be. We constantly look for that very special horse that you won’t want to miss. For the next opportunity that needs to be seized. For the exciting new niche in the equestrian market.

Whether we are encouraging the best out of a warmblood or delivering unmatched technology in our STX, AKX or Ketterer brands… each time we really feel like it is a roll of the dice. And if luck seems to be on our side, it is more because of the Stephex Group’s core values than just our lucky star. Yes, the impossible is possible and there is no fence high enough. There are no problems, only solutions.
